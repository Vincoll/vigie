# Vigie Documentation

Vigie is a high level monitoring software built to monitor various application services. Check endoints with built-in probes and confront the expected result with your own assertions.

Vigie is design to be lightweight, easy to deploy and with simplicity of use in mind.

!!! warning "Alpha Software"
    Vigie is still under heavy dev, you will easily encounter critical bugs.

    This doc is incomplete and will be completed bit by bit when stable features will be added.
